## About Me
<!-- Hi, here is Yaorong Bosco Huang. Currently,I am a Blockchain Security & DeFi Researcher.  -->

Now, I am looking for the **Ph.D.** opportunity in **Blockchain**, **Distributed AI**, **Distributed/Edge Computing**, etc. If you you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.


## Research Interests
I am broadly interested in Distributed AI and Blockchain, aim to build a Blockchain-Empowered Distributed Intelligence system and design a Web3 protocol that supports the development of the Distributed Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystem. Specifically, including:
- **Distributed AI**
  - **Distributed Computing framework**: Distributed Edge Computing, IoT, etc.
  - **Distributed AI framework**: Federated Learning, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Model-as-a-Service (MaaS).
  - **Distributed AI system optimization**: Resource Allocation, Data Privacy, Model Aggregation and Inference, etc.
- **Blockchain**
  - **Blockchain system optimization**: Scalability, Security Decentralization, etc.
  - **Blockchain incentive protocols**: Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), etc.
  - **Blockchain Security**: Smart Contract Security, Abnormal Transaction Monitoring and Detection, etc.
